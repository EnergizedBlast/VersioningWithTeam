I was able to obtain an internship through a company called Boyce Systems where I work as a C# developer and database manager.
 My daily duties include working on creating reports using GrapeCity Reports systems and checking that the reports work using SQL.
 I was also able to continue working a reduced workload at BestBuy during this time frame.

 Over the summer my wife and I were able to continue building our house as well as find out that we are having a baby girl!

 That is about it for my summer!
